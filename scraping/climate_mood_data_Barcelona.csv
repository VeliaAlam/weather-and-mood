These are the preliminary results of  CitieS-Health, a European citizen-science study coordinated by Ideas for Change and the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal)—a centre supported by the ”la Caixa” Foundation—with the goal of measuring how pollution affects the mental health of people in the city.

Specifically, reaction time and cognitive performance can drop by about 5% on a high-pollution day compared to a day with clean air. On days with higher levels of pollution, stress levels also increase by roughly 0.5 (on a scale of 0-10) compared to a clear day. The study also found that, on high-pollution days, the cognitive health of people living close to a green or blue space (such as the sea) is less affected than that of people living farther away, whereas the relationship between air pollution and cognitive well-being does not seem to vary with noise exposure. The findings of the study are currently being written up in a scientific article for validation via the peer-review process.",,10,5,5,0,0,0.07500000000000001
