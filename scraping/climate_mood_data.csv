https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33806787/,"International data suggest that exposure to nature is beneficial for mental health and well-being. The restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic have created a setting that allows us to investigate the importance of greenness exposure on mental health during a period of increased isolation and worry. Based on 2060 responses from an online survey in Stockholm County, Sweden, we investigated: (1) whether the COVID-19 pandemic changed peoples' lifestyle and nature-related habits, and (2) if peoples' mental health differed depending on their exposure to greenness. Neighborhood greenness levels were quantified by using the average normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) within 50 m, 100 m, 300 m, and 500 m buffers surrounding the participant's place of residence. We found that the number of individuals that reported that they visited natural areas ""often"" was significantly higher during the pandemic than before the pandemic. Higher levels of greenness surrounding one's location of residence were in general associated with higher mental health/well-being and vitality scores, and less symptoms of depression, anxiety, and perceived and cognitive stress, after adjustments for demographic variables and walkability. In conclusion, the results from the present study provided support to the suggestion that contact with nature may be important for mental health in extreme circumstances.",['Stockholm'],14,2,11,1,0,-0.021759259259259242

      Mental health is an important public health issue globally.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33799230/,"Methods:
        
      
      A systematic search of peer-reviewed epidemiological studies on heat exposure and mental health outcomes published between January 1990 and November 2020 was conducted using five databases (PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science and PsycINFO). We included studies that examined the association between high ambient temperatures and/or heatwaves and mental health-related mortality and morbidity (e.g. hospital admissions and emergency department visits) in the general population. A range of mental health conditions were defined using ICD-10 classifications. We performed random effects meta-analysis to summarize the relative risks (RRs) in mental health outcomes per 1 °C increase in temperature, and under different heatwaves definitions. We further evaluated whether variables such as age, sex, socioeconomic status, and climate zone may explain the observed heterogeneity.",,11,5,4,2,0,-0.06272727272727273
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33799230/,"Results:
        
      
      The keyword search yielded 4560 citations from which we identified 53 high temperatures/heatwaves studies that comprised over 1.7 million mental health-related mortality and 1.9 million morbidity cases in total. Our findings suggest associations between heat exposures and a range of mental health-related outcomes. Regarding high temperatures, our meta-analysis of study findings showed that for each 1 °C increase in temperature, the mental health-related mortality and morbidity increased with a RR of 1.022 (95%CI: 1.015-1.029) and 1.009 (95%CI: 1.007-1.015), respectively. The greatest mortality risk was attributed to substance-related mental disorders (RR, 1.046; 95%CI: 0.991-1.101), followed by organic mental disorders (RR, 1.033; 95%CI: 1.020-1.046). A 1 °C temperature rise was also associated with a significant increase in morbidity such as mood disorders, organic mental disorders, schizophrenia, neurotic and anxiety disorders. Findings suggest evidence of vulnerability for populations living in tropical and subtropical climate zones, and for people aged more than 65 years. There were significant moderate and high heterogeneities between effect estimates in overall mortality and morbidity categories, respectively. Lower heterogeneity was noted in some subgroups. The magnitude of the effect estimates for heatwaves varied depending on definitions used. The highest effect estimates for mental health-related morbidity was observed when heatwaves were defined as ""mean temperature ≥90th percentile for ≥3 days"" (RR, 1.753; 95%CI: 0.567-5.421), and a significant effect was also observed when the definition was ""mean temperature ≥95th percentile for ≥3 days"", with a RR of 1.064 (95%CI: 1.006-1.123).",,18,10,6,1,1,0.07

      The link between heat exposure and adverse health outcomes in workers is well documented and a growing body of epidemiological evidence from various countries suggests that extreme heat may also contribute to increased risk of occupational injuries (OI). Previously, there have been no comparative reviews assessing the risk of OI due to extreme heat within a wide range of global climate zones. The present review therefore aims to summarise the existing epidemiological evidence on the impact of extreme heat (hot temperatures and heatwaves (HW)) on OI in different climate zones and to assess the individual risk factors associated with workers and workplace that contribute to heat-associated OI risks.",,4,4,0,0,0,-0.04305555555555555
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33472088/,"Methods:
        
      
      A systematic review of published peer-reviewed articles that assessed the effects of extreme heat on OI among non-military workers was undertaken using three databases (PubMed, Embase and Scopus) without temporal or geographical limits from database inception until July 2020. Extreme heat exposure was assessed in terms of hot temperatures and HW periods. For hot temperatures, the effect estimates were converted to relative risks (RR) associated with 1 °C increase in temperature above reference values, while for HW, effect estimates were RR comparing heatwave with non-heatwave periods. The patterns of heat associated OI risk were investigated in different climate zones (according to Köppen Geiger classification) based on the study locations and were estimated using random-effects meta-analysis models. Subgroup analyses according to workers' characteristics (e.g. gender, age group, experience), nature of work (e.g. physical demands, location of work i.e. indoor/outdoor) and workplace characteristics (e.g. industries, business size) were also conducted.",,7,6,0,1,0,0.03125
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33472088/,"Results:
        
      
      A total of 24 studies published between 2005 and 2020 were included in the review. Among these, 22 studies met the eligibility criteria, representing almost 22 million OI across six countries (Australia, Canada, China, Italy, Spain, and USA) and were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled results suggested that the overall risk of OI increased by 1% (RR 1.010, 95% CI: 1.009-1.011) for 1 °C increase in temperature above reference values and 17.4% (RR 1.174, 95% CI: 1.057-1.291) during HW. Among different climate zones, the highest risk of OI during hot temperatures was identified in Humid Subtropical Climates (RR 1.017, 95% CI: 1.014-1.020) followed by Oceanic (RR 1.010, 95% CI: 1.008-1.012) and Hot Mediterranean Climates (RR 1.009, 95% CI: 1.008-1.011). Similarly, Oceanic (RR 1.218, 95% CI: 1.093-1.343) and Humid Subtropical Climates (RR 1.213, 95% CI: 0.995-1.431) had the highest risk of OI during HW periods. No studies assessing the risk of OI in Tropical regions were found. The effects of hot temperatures on the risk of OI were acute with a lag effect of 1-2 days in all climate zones. Young workers (age < 35 years), male workers and workers in agriculture, forestry or fishing, construction and manufacturing industries were at high risk of OI during hot temperatures. Further young workers (age < 35 years), male workers and those working in electricity, gas and water and manufacturing industries were found to be at high risk of OI during HW.",,11,9,0,2,0,0.12470588235294118
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33472088/,"Conclusions:

The combination of packed work schedules and personal chores is a significant source of stress the world over. “I don’t have the time,” often uttered breathlessly in-between tasks, is an all too familiar refrain.

Our main mission is to promote a better organization of time in order to foster a healthier, more efficient and more equal society
—  Sonia Ruiz, Barcelona's Gender and Time Policies Director

Yet, the Barcelona municipality is convinced that a new approach to time is possible, one that encourages citizens’ wellbeing and a higher quality of life.
A trailblazer in Europe, the Catalan city has been adopting revolutionary time-use policies since 2003. The idea is that time is, first and foremost, a right for all citizens and that everyone should be able to reconcile work and personal life.
Sonia Ruiz, Barcelona’s Gender and Time Policies director.
“Our main mission is to promote a better organization of time in order to foster a healthier, more efficient and more equal society,” says Sonia Ruiz, Gender and Time Policies director at the Barcelona City Council.
Under the slogan ‘Barcelona, city of time and people’, the municipality has been challenging job-centred schedules to help citizens find a better work/life balance.
The aim is to allow people to devote more hours to leisure, family and social activities. 
“Barcelona was one of the first European cities and certainly the first in Spain to promote time-use policies. The request for a time revision was initially driven by feminist and social movements and eventually integrated into the city’s policy agenda,” explains Ruiz, who leads Barcelona’s time policies along with Sara Berbel, the city manager .
This sweeping reform has been unfolding through some 70 programmes: from time banks to extended municipal service hours to policies for overwhelmed caregivers and single mothers.

Borrowing time at the bank

Since my mother started to live with us, my hours have changed but thanks to remote assistance I have time for myself
— Maria, Barcelona resident

For many, time is often as scarce as money so one of the city’s first steps was the introduction of ‘Time Banks’ where people can deposit and receive back hours of services devoted to the community.
Reading books to children or helping them with homework, caring for the sick, looking after pets and plants when homeowners are away, taking the elderly for a walk, carrying out home repair works are some of the activities that can be performed and deposited at Barcelona’s Time Banks. In return, the person performing hours of voluntary work will receive similar services from other participants.
The scheme introduces a new type of social exchange to meet the demands of residents of all ages. It helps many break the cycle of isolation and fosters a new type of cooperation, with time as the new currency.
Solidarity is central to Barcelona’s time reform. It implies an understanding that certain categories of citizens are engaged in a particularly fierce battle with time, one that sees them consistently losing.
Since 2008, several programs have been targetting one of the most time deprived members of society: caregiving families.
Thanks to the ‘Time for you service’, for instance, professionals carry out leisure activities and games with people with special needs of different ages, releasing the pressure on family members.
Other initiatives have been offering much needed respite to residents looking after aging parents, helping people like 67-year-old Maria to regain some personal space.
“Since my mother started to live with us, my hours have changed but thanks to remote assistance I have time for myself. Whenever I’m not at home, she can contact the assistance services in case of any problems and I can do my own things, like swimming in my neighborhood’s sport centre,” Maria explains.

In the library at midnight
Other projects have a wider impact on Barcelona residents of all ages, stretching public services’ hours to make them accessible to people who are otherwise busy during the day.
The 2020 ‘Libraries and Timetables’ programme, for example, extends local libraries’ schedules to the late evening, to the delight of residents like 21-year-old Marco: “The opening times of my neighborhood library are perfect for me. The night rooms are accessible until 1:00 in the morning. I can practice my conversational skills in English in a group and I can connect my computer to the library’s wifi. There’s a night bus stop near the library and I can also go back home by metro,” he says.
Digital technologies are also lending a helping hand. The city’s ‘Save time with online procedures’ initiative reduces the hours citizens devote to bureaucracy and helps to avoid time-consuming trips to municipal offices.
Self-service kiosks and online application procedures facilitate residents with hectic schedules like 36-year-old Azra.
“I’ve had to fill a lot of paperwork so that my family in Peru could join me here. Since I work far away from home, I was able to find the information I needed on the Barcelona Municipality website. Thanks to this system, I was able to take care of the forms during my free time on Saturdays,” Azra says.
A new type of poverty: time deprivation
In modern days, individuals spend an increasing amount of time at work, to the detriment of their private lives. This deficit has created a new category of deprivation: time poverty.

All single mothers have one thing in common: they might enjoy a stable economic situation or have a good job but they’re all poor in time
—  Sonia Ruiz, Barcelona's Gender and Time Policies Director

It affects people who have enough money and who can’t be technically considered poor but only because they spend long hours at the workplace, Barcelona city officials say.
Time deprivation weighs more heavily on women than men and one of the goals of Barcelona’s time reform is to address this gender disparity.
“Lack of time fosters inequalities that affect people differently depending on their class, age and especially gender. All single mothers, for instance, have one thing in common: they might enjoy a stable economic situation or have a good job but they’re all poor in time,” Ruiz says.
Gender-related time poverty is an all-too-common problem around the world, studies show. The ‘Guide on Poverty Measurement’ of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), for instance, illustrates a penalising time deficit just around the corner from the European Union’s borders.
Turkey stands out in the charts, with a time poverty rate among full-time working women of 70% versus men’s 37%. UNECE data also highlight peaks in Albania and Serbia where women “perform more than twice as much unpaid labour as men.”

Any help a parent can get
In Spain, the Covid-19 pandemic exasperated gender imbalances. “With the 2020 lockdown schools remained closed for months, placing an extra burden on families and especially single mothers, who make up over 80% of single parents,” says Ruiz.
The emergency has prompted Barcelona to come to the rescue by devising programmes like ‘Concilia’, ‘Reconcile’.
“The project offers free childcare services to people who need to go to work or to run errands and who don’t have anyone looking after their children. It started in October 2020 in seven of the city’s most vulnerable neighbourhoods and it will now be expanded to an additional five. It proved to be a great help for single mothers, but everyone else can use it,” the Gender and Time Policies director says.
A similar set of initiatives targets time-deprived parents of both genders. Projects like the 2005 ‘Open Schoolyards’ extend playgrounds and public spaces’ openings outside of school hours so that parents like 39-year-old Ramon can hang out with their children on their days off. “My daughter and I go to the school playground which remains open on Saturdays,” he says.
Health consequences
In Barcelona, the reshuffling of hours and services is propped up by the idea that a better organisation of time has a direct, positive impact on people’s health and overall wellbeing. The recipients of the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine have illustriously emphasized how disturbances to the body’s internal clock have a direct link with diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular diseases and mental dysfunctions.
“The issue is particularly relevant in Spain where meals and social activities are pushed forward in the day, setting in motion mind and body disruptions,” Ruiz says.
“In Spain we tend to eat our lunches very late during the day, at around 14:00 or even 15:00. We also have late dinners and go to bed very late which causes disturbances to our body rhythms. This is why we’ve created a series of programmes on local television to raise awareness about the connection between time management and health. This tv campaign encourages residents to embrace a healthier time schedule by, for instance, moving up their lunch and dinner times,” she adds.
Exporting the time-reform model
In later years, Barcelona has broadened its time revolution by inviting others to join in.
The 2011 Time Pact now includes 131 businesses and some 240 civil society organisations in Barcelona, from health to trade unions to women’s to community-based organisations.
In addition, the municipality awards and offers grants to local businesses that show a commitment to the work/life balance of their employees by adopting measures such as avoiding work on rest days, cutting the number of work meetings or guaranteeing the right to digital disconnection.
The city’s latest efforts are concentrated on further extending the reach of its time-related interventions.
In recent years, the Barcelona Time Use Initiative has been aiming at exporting the time revolution’s know-how and best practices beyond the local and national confines.
The new Barcelona Declaration on Time Policies is part of this drive. Starting from October, the Catalan city will work in tandem with private and public institutions, organisations and research centres around the world to devise new time solutions for a fairer society at both a European and local level.",['Barcelona'],17,0,1,15,1,0.1286032023532023
